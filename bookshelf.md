Generally, I'm up for reading _anything_. Be it history, engineering or metaphysics. Nevertheless, there are some books I've really loved reading. I would definitely suggest you to have a look at them too (not necessarily in an order).

P.S. Metaphysics is starkly different from Physics, btw üòù

### Self-help
 1. **How to Stop Worrying and Start Living** by *Dale Carnegie* &mdash; This is seriously one of those books  which _everyone_ of this hustling era has to read. It's like an instruction manual for being totally worry-free.
 2. **The Greatest Salesman in the World** by *Og Mandino* &mdash; A short but _very_ impactful book which unravels an intriguing story whilst putting forth the 10 most important traits to make the world yours.
 3. **The Subtle Art of not Giving a F\*ck** by *Mark Manson* &mdash; Now, this one's very different from the other books in this genre. By different I mean the unique and badass writing style of Mark Manson. Sometimes shocking, sometimes stern but always insightful.

### Non-fiction
 1. **Sapiens** by *Yuval Noah Harari* &mdash; If you love general science and would love to get some food for thought about how _Homo Sapiens_ came to this very stage, Sapiens would do just that. 
 It is like a well-mixed concoction of Harari's opinions/hypotheses and proofs of some actual phenomena.
 2. **Ikigai** by *H√©ctor Garc√≠a and Francesc Miralles* &mdash; I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about this one. Although, I thoroughly appreciate it. The book sheds light on a myriad things which are pretty essential for living a healthy lifestyle (happy follows, doesn't it?).

### Fiction
 1. **The Da Vinci Code** and **Angels and Demons** by *Dan Brown* &mdash; I have literally been hooked on to these books from the start to end. These 2 books are so full of thrill and intricate writing that they just teleport you to a new dimension.
 2. **All-night Party** by *R.L. Stine* (quite an old one) &mdash; A perfect bite-sized thriller for that lonely flight trip that just popped up in your life out of nowhere. Maybe a bit childish but it was pretty fun.
