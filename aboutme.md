<p style="text-align: center;"> I am Anudeep <br> I code and play basketball <br> Also game maybe? <br> <br> (Try Googling "Haiku" &#128541;) </p>

I'm Anudeep Tubati (yes, this is the last time I'm telling my name, promise) and I've graduated in CS from [IIT Dharwad](https://iitdh.ac.in/), India.

Oh, you're still reading? Thenks for showing so much interest\
For starters, I'm from Hyderabad, Telangana, India (the [best city](https://www.thehansindia.com/telangana/hyderabad-ranks-best-city-to-live-in-india-for-fifth-time-in-a-row-511940) in India, duh).

Favorite quotes? I usually love a lot of quotes, have a whole collection of 'em. However, there are 2 particular quotes which blow my mind everytime I read them.
> A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. &mdash; Franklin D. Roosevelt\
> We accept the love we think we deserve. &mdash; Stephen Chbosky, [The Perks of Being a Wallflower](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1659337/)

Aaaaand, one of my own
> In the end, we all believe what we want to believe. My writings and arguments are never aimed to make someone believe in something they don't want to believe in, rather, they're aimed to give a reason to those who want to believe in them.

### <a name="why-do-i-write">Why do I write? </a>
There's no denying that right now, in the world, there's so much stress, depression, existential crisis and what not. I hope to reduce that, by even a teeny tiny bit if at all, with my writing. I love the concept of sharing. I want to share whatever small things I learn with everyone. I don't really know if they'll work for you, but I'll definitely share stuff that has worked for me. So, I guess it's worth a shot.

### The End
(of my brain power for a while)
