subtitle: Ahem ahem, want to write my biography?

When I'm not configuring VS Code and my shell to my exact taste, I play basketball, video games, and read.

There are 2 particular quotes which blow my mind everytime I read them.
> A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. &mdash; Franklin D. Roosevelt\
> We accept the love we think we deserve. &mdash; Stephen Chbosky, [The Perks of Being a Wallflower](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1659337/)

### <a name="why-do-i-write">Why do I write? </a>
> In the end, we all believe what we want to believe. My writings and arguments are never aimed to make someone believe in something they don't want to believe in, rather, they're aimed to give a reason to those who want to believe in them.

I love the concept of sharing. I want to share whatever small things I learn with everyone. I don't really know if they'll work for you, but they have worked for me. So, I guess it's worth a shot.

### The End
(of my brain power for a while)
