subtitle: Hey there! Welcome to my web-space.
intropara: I'm Anudeep Tubati, a CS grad from NYU. I love to code, build, play basketball, read, and sometimes, even write. I use this space to write about life, tech and whatever fun stuff that comes to my mind. <br><br> <a href="aboutme/#why-do-i-write">Why do I write? </a> <br><br> Anyway, here goes my blog ;)
